# Npontu App/Ops Officer Internship Assignment  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains my submission for the **App/Ops Officer Internship Assignment** at **Npontu Technologies LTD**. The task involved analyzing sample application logs, identifying the root cause of a performance issue, and creating a **runbook** for troubleshooting similar problems in the future.  

## 📂 Contents  
- **Npontu_Technologies_Interview_Assignment.docx** – Full written report (logs, root cause analysis, and troubleshooting runbook).  
- *(Optional)* `logs.txt` – A plain text version of the sample logs used in the analysis.  

## 🛠️ Summary of Work  
- **Sample Logs**: Created a set of logs simulating real-world application issues (database timeouts, high CPU usage, memory leaks).  
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified that database connection saturation and memory leaks caused cascading performance failures.  
- **Runbook**: Developed a structured troubleshooting guide covering:  
  - Database connection checks  
  - System resource monitoring  
  - API performance investigations  
  - Restart/recovery procedures  
  - Preventive measures (monitoring, alerts, code fixes)  

## 🚀 How to Use  
1. Review the DOCX file for the complete solution.  
2. Open `logs.txt` (if included) to view the raw application logs referenced.
